                <li>200g Spaghetti</li>
                <li>100g Pancetta, diced</li>
                <li>2 large Eggs</li>
                <li>50g Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
                <li>Freshly ground Black pepper</li>
                <li>Salt, to taste</li>
                <li>1 clove Garlic, peeled and crushed (optional)</li>
                <li>2 tbsp Olive oil</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente.</li>
                <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the pancetta and garlic (if using) and cook until the pancetta is crispy and the garlic is fragrant. Remove the garlic and discard.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and grated Parmesan cheese until well combined.</li>
                <li>Drain the spaghetti, reserving a cup of the pasta water. Add the spaghetti to the skillet with the pancetta and toss to combine.</li>
                <li>Remove the skillet from the heat and quickly pour in the egg and cheese mixture, tossing the pasta continuously to create a creamy sauce. Add reserved pasta water a little at a time if the sauce is too thick.</li>
                <li>Season with freshly ground black pepper and salt to taste. Serve immediately, garnished with extra Parmesan cheese and black pepper if desired.</li>
            </ol>
